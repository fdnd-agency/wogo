Like a well-made cocktail, WOGO considers going out an unforgettable experience. We want to bring people together who value good drinks, beautiful bars and above all, good company. So our mission is for our people to discover cocktails and enjoy great nights out. That's why we constantly search for the best bars and places to visit and partner up with the best (spirit) brands to deliver unforgettable moments, so our customers never have to worry about where they're going!

The goal is to continue this spirit and give bars and brands a stage for cocktail newbies and enthusiasts alike.
